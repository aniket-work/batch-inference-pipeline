## Batch Inference Pipeline

### Overview

This pipeline is designed to process a large volume of data using batch inference, a technique that allows for the processing of multiple inputs at once. The pipeline takes in input data, performs batch inference using a trained machine learning model, and outputs the results to a specified location.

### Requirements

To run this pipeline, you will need:

- A trained machine learning model
- Input data to be processed
- Computing resources capable of handling the size of the input data and model

### Pipeline Steps

1. **Input Data Preparation:** Prepare the input data to be processed. This may include data cleaning, formatting, and preprocessing as required by the model.

2. **Batch Inference:** Use the trained machine learning model to perform batch inference on the input data. This can be done using a batch inference library or by implementing a custom batch inference function.

3. **Output Results:** Save the results of the batch inference to a specified location, such as a file or database.

### Usage

To use this pipeline, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Prepare your input data as required by the model.
3. Modify the pipeline script to specify the location of the input data and desired output location.
4. Run the pipeline script.

### Example

An example implementation of this pipeline can be found in the `batch_inference.py` file in this repository. This implementation uses the scikit-learn library for batch inference on a simple dataset of iris flowers. To run the example, follow the usage instructions above and specify the `iris.csv` file as the input data.
